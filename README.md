# Virtual Masons Take Home Project

Hello!
This is Alex's attempt at the Take Home Project.

#Installation
- prepare an api key on the New York Times API
- clone the repo
- navigate to the project in a terminal and run `yarn`
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following inside

`REACT_APP_NYT_API_KEY = "{Your Api Key}"`

#Running the project
- run `yarn start` to run the project in devmode
- run `yarn build` to create a production build


#Further Steps
Here are some of the things I would do if this were a production app
- I would take the time to make cleaner more atomized git commits.
- Add unit and selenium testing
- If this project were more complex, I would integrate redux. I was considering using redux, but the project and data flow were simple enough that it could easily be implemented without redux.
- Style the project to fit in with the rest of the site.
- I might make a set of install scripts that automate processes such as yarn install and setting api key configs.
